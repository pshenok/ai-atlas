# RAG+ (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Plus)

## Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation Plus (RAG+) represents an evolution of the standard RAG paradigm, encompassing advanced techniques and optimizations that enhance retrieval quality, relevance, and integration with language models. While basic RAG simply retrieves relevant documents and feeds them to an LLM, RAG+ employs sophisticated strategies to overcome fundamental limitations in retrieval accuracy, context handling, and information synthesis.

RAG+ addresses key challenges in traditional RAG implementations: retrieval of irrelevant information, missed critical content, context window limitations, and inefficient processing of complex information needs. By incorporating multiple retrieval methods, recursive search strategies, and dynamic context handling, RAG+ significantly improves the quality and reliability of AI-generated responses for knowledge-intensive tasks.

## How It Works

RAG+ builds upon the basic RAG framework by incorporating multiple advanced components:

1. **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines multiple search strategies (semantic, lexical, and hybrid approaches) to maximize coverage and precision.

2. **Multi-tier Retrieval**: Implements hierarchical approaches to document retrieval, starting with broad searches and progressively narrowing down to specific content.

3. **Recursive Retrieval**: Enables iterative search refinement based on initial results, allowing for progressive information gathering for complex queries.

4. **Adaptive Context Management**: Dynamically selects, prioritizes, and formats retrieved information to optimize the context provided to the LLM.

5. **Post-retrieval Processing**: Applies techniques like reranking, filtering, and highlighting to improve the quality of retrieved context.

The core workflow typically follows these steps:

```
1. Query Analysis → Determine search approach based on query type
2. Initial Retrieval → Apply hybrid retrieval methods
3. Context Evaluation → Assess relevance and completeness
4. Recursive Search → Perform additional targeted retrievals if needed
5. Context Optimization → Rerank, filter, and format for LLM consumption
6. Generation → Produce response with optimized context
7. Verification → Optionally validate output against sources
```

## Key Components

### 1. Hybrid Search Mechanisms

RAG+ employs multiple retrieval approaches in parallel or sequence:

- **Dense Retrieval**: Using embedding-based semantic search
  ```python
  # Semantic search with embeddings
  query_embedding = embedding_model.encode(query)
  semantic_results = vector_db.search(query_embedding, k=5)
  ```

- **Sparse Retrieval**: Using keyword-based methods like BM25
  ```python
  # Lexical search with BM25
  lexical_results = lexical_index.search(query, k=5)
  ```

- **Hybrid Reranking**: Combining results from multiple retrieval methods
  ```python
  # Combine and rerank results
  all_results = merge_results(semantic_results, lexical_results)
  reranked_results = rerank_model.rerank(query, all_results)
  ```

### 2. Multi-tier Retrieval Architecture

Implementation of hierarchical document retrieval:

- **Coarse-to-Fine Approach**: Starting with document-level retrieval, then paragraph or sentence-level
  ```python
  # First-tier: retrieve relevant documents
  relevant_docs = doc_retriever.search(query, k=3)
  
  # Second-tier: retrieve specific passages from those documents
  passages = []
  for doc in relevant_docs:
      doc_passages = passage_retriever.search(query, doc, k=2)
      passages.extend(doc_passages)
  ```

- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Maintaining hierarchical context
  ```python
  # Retrieve with parent context
  for passage in passages:
      passage.metadata["parent_title"] = passage.source_document.title
      passage.metadata["document_context"] = passage.source_document.summary
  ```

### 3. Query Transformation Techniques

Methods to improve initial queries:

- **Query Expansion**: Enriching queries with additional terms
  ```python
  expanded_terms = query_expansion_model.expand(query)
  expanded_query = f"{query} {' '.join(expanded_terms)}"
  ```

- **Query Decomposition**: Breaking complex queries into sub-questions
  ```python
  sub_questions = query_decomposition_model.decompose(query)
  sub_results = []
  for sub_q in sub_questions:
      sub_results.append(retriever.search(sub_q))
  ```

- **Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)**: Using an LLM to generate a hypothetical answer, then retrieving based on that
  ```python
  hypothetical_answer = llm.generate(f"Generate a detailed answer to: {query}")
  hyde_results = retriever.search_by_text(hypothetical_answer)
  ```

### 4. Adaptive Context Management

Strategies for optimizing context window usage:

- **Dynamic Chunking**: Adjusting chunk size based on content
  ```python
  # Dynamic chunking based on semantic coherence
  chunks = adaptive_chunker.chunk(document, 
                                  min_size=100, 
                                  max_size=500, 
                                  respect_semantic_units=True)
  ```

- **Relevance Filtering**: Removing less relevant content
  ```python
  # Filter chunks by relevance score
  filtered_chunks = [c for c in retrieved_chunks if c.relevance_score > 0.75]
  ```

- **Context Compression**: Condensing retrieved information
  ```python
  # Compress lengthy contexts
  compressed_context = context_compressor.compress(chunks, max_tokens=3000)
  ```

### 5. Post-retrieval Enhancement

Techniques to improve retrieved context quality:

- **Cross-document Synthesis**: Combining information across documents
  ```python
  # Create a synthesized context from multiple sources
  synthesized_context = llm.generate(
      f"Synthesize the following information to answer: {query}\n" +
      "\n".join([doc.content for doc in retrieved_docs])
  )
  ```

- **Citation and Attribution**: Tracking source information
  ```python
  # Include source tracking
  for chunk in chunks:
      chunk.metadata["source"] = chunk.document_id
      chunk.metadata["page"] = chunk.page_number
  ```

## Implementation Approaches

### Basic RAG+ Implementation

```python
def rag_plus_query(query, retriever, llm):
    # 1. Analyze query to determine approach
    query_type = classify_query(query)
    
    # 2. Perform hybrid retrieval
    semantic_results = retriever.semantic_search(query, k=5)
    lexical_results = retriever.keyword_search(query, k=5)
    combined_results = hybrid_merge(semantic_results, lexical_results)
    
    # 3. Assess if we need deeper context
    if needs_recursive_search(query, combined_results):
        # 4. Generate follow-up queries
        follow_up_queries = generate_follow_up_queries(query, combined_results)
        additional_results = []
        for fq in follow_up_queries:
            additional_results.extend(retriever.search(fq, k=2))
        combined_results = rerank_all(query, combined_results + additional_results)
    
    # 5. Format context for the LLM
    formatted_context = format_for_llm(combined_results, query_type)
    
    # 6. Generate response
    response = llm.generate(
        prompt_template.format(query=query, context=formatted_context)
    )
    
    return response
```

### Advanced Implementation with LangChain

```python
from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import EmbeddingsFilter
from langchain.retrievers.ensemble import EnsembleRetriever
from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chain
from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain

# Create base retrievers
embedding_retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_type="similarity")
bm25_retriever = BM25Retriever(index)

# Create ensemble retriever
ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[embedding_retriever, bm25_retriever],
    weights=[0.7, 0.3]
)

# Add filtering 
filter_compressor = EmbeddingsFilter(embeddings=embeddings, similarity_threshold=0.76)
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
    base_compressor=filter_compressor,
    base_retriever=ensemble_retriever
)

# Create chains
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("""
Answer the following question based on the provided context:
<context>
{context}
</context>
Question: {input}
""")

document_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)
retrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(compression_retriever, document_chain)

# Query
response = retrieval_chain.invoke({"input": query})
```

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Recency Biasing**: Prioritize more recent information for time-sensitive queries
- **Progressive Loading**: Implement strategies for loading additional context when needed
- **Hierarchical Context**: Include document-level context alongside specific passages

### Evaluation Framework

- **Retrieval Metrics**: Track precision, recall, and coverage separately from generation quality
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different RAG+ configurations on the same query set
- **User Feedback Integration**: Collect and incorporate user feedback on relevance
- **Hallucination Detection**: Implement verification to identify unsupported claims

## Examples

### Multi-hop Question Answering

```
Query: "What influence did the economic policies of the Tang Dynasty have on medieval European trade?"

RAG+ Process:
1. Initial retrieval finds information about Tang Dynasty economic policies
2. System detects missing information about connection to Europe
3. Generates sub-query: "Trade routes connecting Tang Dynasty China and medieval Europe"
4. Second retrieval finds information about the Silk Road and Byzantine connections
5. Final retrieval combines sources to trace influence pathways
6. Information is synthesized into comprehensive response with proper attribution
```

### Technical Troubleshooting

```
Query: "My Kubernetes pods keep crashing with OOMKilled errors after upgrading to version 1.25. How can I fix this?"

RAG+ Process:
1. Initial hybrid retrieval finds general information about OOMKilled errors
2. System identifies version-specific relevance
3. Targeted retrieval for "Kubernetes 1.25 memory management changes"
4. Retrieves documentation and community discussions about memory changes
5. Generates response with multiple potential solutions, citing sources
```
