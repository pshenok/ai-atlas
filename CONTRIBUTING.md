## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before contributing.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to AI-Atlas:

1. **Add new content:** Create new pages for AI techniques, patterns, or concepts not yet covered
2. **Improve existing content:** Expand, clarify, or update information in existing pages
3. **Add examples:** Provide practical implementation examples and code snippets
4. **Technical review:** Review content for technical accuracy and completeness
5. **Language editing:** Improve clarity, fix typos, and enhance readability
6. **Organization:** Suggest improvements to repository structure and navigation
7. **Translations:** Help translate content to make it accessible to non-English speakers
8. **Issue reporting:** Report errors, outdated information, or suggest new topics

## Content Guidelines

### General Principles

- **Accuracy:** Information should be technically accurate and up-to-date
- **Clarity:** Explanations should be clear and accessible to the target audience
- **Practicality:** Focus on practical implementation and real-world usage
- **Completeness:** Cover important aspects of the topic comprehensively
- **Attribution:** Properly cite sources, papers, and inspirations

### Writing Style

- Write in clear, concise language
- Define technical terms when they're first used
- Use active voice where possible
- Break complex concepts into digestible sections
- Include examples to illustrate concepts
- Target an intermediate technical audience, but provide both basic and advanced information

### Visuals and Diagrams

- Include diagrams, flowcharts, or illustrations where they help explain concepts
- Use consistent visual styling where possible
- Provide alt text for accessibility
- Credit the source of any visuals you didn't create yourself

## File Structure and Formatting

### Directory Organization

New content should be placed in the appropriate section:

```
/AI-Atlas
  /foundation              # Core AI concepts and architectures
  /language-models         # NLP, LLMs, and text-based AI
  /computer-vision         # Image, video, and visual processing AI
  /multimodal              # Systems combining multiple input/output modalities
  /reinforcement-learning  # RL techniques and applications
  /generative-ai           # Creative and generative systems
  /tools                   # Frameworks, platforms, and development tools
  ...
```

If you're unsure where your content belongs, open an issue to discuss it.

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `chain-of-thought.md`, `diffusion-models.md`)
- Be descriptive but concise
- Avoid special characters and spaces

### Markdown Formatting

- Use Markdown for all content
- Follow the template structure for the type of content you're creating
- Use headings (# to ####) to organize content hierarchically
- Use inline code blocks for short code snippets and fenced code blocks (```) for longer examples
- Include language identifiers in code blocks (e.g., ```python)
- Use relative links for internal references
